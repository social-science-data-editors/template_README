\section{Template README and
Guidance}\label{template-readme-and-guidance}}

\begin{quote}
INSTRUCTIONS: This README suggests structure and content that have been
approved by various journals, see \href{Endorsers.md}{Endorsers}. It is
available as
\href{https://github.com/social-science-data-editors/template_README/blob/master/template-README.md}{Markdown/txt},
\href{templates/README.docx}{Word}, \href{templates/README.tex}{LaTeX},
and \href{templates/README.pdf}{PDF}. In practice, there are many
variations and complications, and authors should feel free to adapt to
their needs. All instructions can (should) be removed from the final
README (in Markdown, remove lines starting with
\texttt{\textgreater{}\ INSTRUCTIONS}). Please ensure that a PDF is
submitted in addition to the chosen native format.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{data-availability-statements}{%
\subsection{Data Availability
Statements}\label{data-availability-statements}}

\begin{quote}
INSTRUCTIONS: Every README should contain a description of the location
and accessibility of the data used in the article. These descriptions
are generally referred to as ``Data Availability Statements'' (DAS).
This should include ALL data, regardless of whether they are provided as
part of the replication archive or not, and regardless of size or scope.
For instance, if using deflators, the source of the deflators (e.g.~at
the national statistical office) should also be listed here. DAS can be
complex and varied. Examples are provided
\href{Requested_information_dcas.md}{here}, and below.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
INSTRUCTIONS: If providing a datafile per data source, list them here;
if providing combined/derived datafiles, list them separately after the
DAS.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
INSTRUCTIONS: DAS do not replace Data Citations (see
\href{Data_citation_guidance.md}{Guidance}). Rather, they augment them.
Depending on journal requirements and to some extent stylistic
considerations, data citations should appear in the main article, in an
appendix, or in the README. However, data citations only provide
information \textbf{where} to find the data, not \textbf{how to access}
that data. Thus, DAS augment data citations by going into additional
detail that allow a researcher to assess cost, complexity, and
availability over time of the data used by the original author.

\subsubsection{Example for confidential
data:}\label{example-for-confidential-data}}

\begin{quote}
INSTRUCTIONS: Citing and describing confidential data, in particular
when it does not have a regular distribution channel or online landing
page, can be tricky. A citation can be crafted
(\href{FAQ.html\#data-citation-without-online-link}{see guidance}), and
the DAS should describe how to access, whom to contact (including the
role of the particular person, should that person retire), and other
relevant information, such as required citizenship status or cost.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The data for this project (DESE, 2019) are confidential, but may be
obtained with Data Use Agreements with the Massachusetts Department of
Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). Researchers interested in
access to the data may contact {[}NAME{]} at {[}EMAIL{]}, also see
www.doe.mass.edu/research/contact.html. It can take some months to
negotiate data use agreements and gain access to the data. The author
will assist with any reasonable replication attempts for two years
following publication.

All the results in the paper use confidential microdata from the U.S.
Census Bureau. To gain access to the Census microdata, follow the
directions here on how to write a proposal for access to the data via a
Federal Statistical Research Data Center:
https://www.census.gov/ces/rdcresearch/howtoapply.html. You must request
the following datasets in your proposal: 1. Longitudinal Business
Database (LBD), 2002 and 2007 2. Foreign Trade Database -- Import (IMP),
2002 and 2007 {[}\ldots{]}

\begin{quote}
INSTRUCTIONS: In some cases, authors will provide one dataset (file) per
data source, and the code to combine them. In others, in particular when
data access might be restrictive, the replication package may only
include derived/analysis data. Every file should be described. This can
be provided as a Excel/CSV table, or in the table below (preferred).

\subsection{Computational
requirements}\label{computational-requirements}}

\begin{quote}
INSTRUCTIONS: In general, the specific computer code used to generate
the results in the article will be within the repository that also
contains this README. However, other computational requirements - shared
libraries or code packages, required software, specific computing
hardware - may be important, and is always useful, for the goal of
replication. Some example text follows.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
INSTRUCTIONS: We strongly suggest providing setup scripts that
install/set up the environment. Sample scripts for
\href{https://github.com/gslab-econ/template/blob/master/config/config_stata.do}{Stata},
\href{https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/paper-template/blob/master/programs/global-libraries.R}{R},

INSTRUCTIONS: List all of the software requirements, up to and including
any operating system requirements, for the entire set of code. It is
suggested to distribute most dependencies together with the replication
package if allowed, in particular if sourced from unversioned code
repositories, Github repos, and personal webpages.

\subsubsection{Memory and Runtime
Requirements}\label{memory-and-runtime-requirements}}

\begin{quote}
INSTRUCTIONS: Memory and compute-time requirements may also be relevant
or even critical. Some example text follows. It may be useful to break
this out by Table/Figure/section of processing. For instance, some
estimation routines might run for weeks, but data prep and creating
figures might only take a few minutes.

\hypertarget{description-of-programs}{%
\subsection{Description of programs}\label{description-of-programs}}

\begin{quote}
INSTRUCTIONS: Give a high-level overview of the program files and their
purpose. Remove redundant/ obsolete files from the Replication archive.
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Programs in \texttt{programs/01\_dataprep} will extract and reformat
  all datasets referenced above. The file
  \texttt{programs/01\_dataprep/master.do} will run them all.
\item
  Programs in \texttt{programs/02\_analysis} generate all tables and
  figures in the main body of the article. The program
  \texttt{programs/02\_analysis/master.do} will run them all. Each
  program called from \texttt{master.do} identifies the table or figure
  it creates (e.g., \texttt{05\_table5.do}). Output files are called
  appropriate names (\texttt{table5.tex}, \texttt{figure12.png}) and
  should be easy to correlate with the manuscript.
\item
  Programs in \texttt{programs/03\_appendix} will generate all tables
  and figures in the online appendix. The program
  \texttt{programs/03\_appendix/master-appendix.do} will run them all.
\item
  Ado files have been stored in \texttt{programs/ado} and the
  \texttt{master.do} files set the ADO directories appropriately.
\item
  The program \texttt{programs/00\_setup.do} will populate the
  \texttt{programs/ado} directory with updated ado packages, but for
  purposes of exact reproduction, this is not needed. The file
  \texttt{programs/00\_setup.log} identifies the versions as they were
  last updated.
\item
  The program \texttt{programs/config.do} contains parameters used by
  all programs, including a random seed. Note that the random seed is
  set once for each of the two sequences (in \texttt{02\_analysis} and
  \texttt{03\_appendix}). If running in any order other than the one
  outlined below, your results may differ.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{instructions-to-replicators}{%
\subsection{Instructions to
Replicators}\label{instructions-to-replicators}}

\begin{quote}
INSTRUCTIONS: The first two sections ensure that the data and software
necessary to conduct the replication have been collected. This section
then describes a human-readable instruction to conduct the replication.
This may be simple, or may involve many complicated steps. It should be
a simple list, no excess prose. Strict linear sequence. If more than 4-5
manual steps, please wrap a master program/Makefile around them, in
logical sequences. Examples follow.
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Edit \texttt{programs/config.do} to adjust the default path
\item
  Run \texttt{programs/00\_setup.do} once on a new system to set up the
  working environment.
\item
  Download the data files referenced above. Each should be stored in the
  prepared subdirectories of \texttt{data/}, in the format that you
  download them in. Do not unzip. Scripts are provided in each directory
  to download the public-use files. Confidential data files requested as
  part of your FSRDC project will appear in the \texttt{/data} folder.
  No further action is needed on the replicator's part.
\item
  Run \texttt{programs/01\_master.do} to run all steps in sequence.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{details}{%
\subsubsection{Details}\label{details}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{programs/00\_setup.do}: will create all output directories,
  install needed ado packages.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If wishing to update the ado packages used by this archive, change
    the parameter \texttt{update\_ado} to \texttt{yes}. However, this is
    not needed to successfully reproduce the manuscript tables.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{programs/01\_dataprep}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    These programs were last run at various times in 2018.
  \item
    Order does not matter, all programs can be run in parallel, if
    needed.
  \item
    A \texttt{programs/01\_dataprep/master.do} will run them all in
    sequence, which should take about 2 hours.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{programs/02\_analysis/master.do}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If running programs individually, note that ORDER IS IMPORTANT.
  \item
    The programs were last run top to bottom on July 4, 2019.
  \end{itemize}

\hypertarget{list-of-tables-and-programs}{%
\subsection{List of tables and
programs}\label{list-of-tables-and-programs}}

\begin{quote}
INSTRUCTIONS: Your programs should clearly identify the tables and
figures as they appear in the manuscript, by number. Sometimes, this may
be obvious, e.g.~a program called ``\texttt{table1.do}'' generates a
file called \texttt{table1.png}. Sometimes, mnemonics are used, and a
mapping is necessary. In all circumstances, provide a list of tables and
figures, identifying the program (and possibly the line number) where a
figure is created.
