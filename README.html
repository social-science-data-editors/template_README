<h1 id="template-readme-and-guidance">Template README and Guidance</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: This README suggests structure and content that have been approved by various journals, see <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/Endorsers.html">Endorsers</a>. It is available as <a href="https://github.com/social-science-data-editors/template_README/blob/master/template-README.html">Markdown/txt</a>, <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/templates/README.docx">Word</a>, <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/templates/README.tex">LaTeX</a>, and <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/templates/README.pdf">PDF</a>. In practice, there are many variations and complications, and authors should feel free to adapt to their needs. All instructions can (should) be removed from the final README (in Markdown, remove lines starting with <code>&gt; INSTRUCTIONS</code>). Please ensure that a PDF is submitted in addition to the chosen native format.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: The typical README in social science journals serves the purpose of guiding a reader through the available material and a route to replicating the results in the research paper. Start by providing a brief overview of the available material and a brief guide as to how to proceed from beginning to end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example: The code in this replication package constructs the analysis file from the three data sources (Ruggles et al, 2018; Inglehart et al, 2019; BEA, 2016) using Stata and Julia. Two master files run all of the code to generate the data for the 15 figures and 3 tables in the paper. The replicator should expect the code to run for about 14 hours.</p>
<h2 id="data-availability-and-provenance-statements">Data Availability and Provenance Statements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Every README should contain a description of the origin (provenance), location and accessibility (data availability) of the data used in the article. These descriptions are generally referred to as “Data Availability Statements” (DAS). However, in some cases, there is no external data used.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
This paper does not involve analysis of external data (i.e., no data are used or the only data are generated by the authors via simulation in their code).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If box above is checked and if no simulated/synthetic data files are provided by the authors, please skip directly to the section on <a href="#computational-requirements">Computational Requirements</a>. Otherwise, continue.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: - When the authors are <strong>secondary data users</strong> (they did not generate the data), the provenance and DAS coincide, and should describe the condition under which (a) the current authors (b) any future users might access the data. - When the data were generated (by the authors) in the course of conducting (lab or field) <strong>experiments</strong>, or were collected as part of <strong>surveys</strong>, then the description of the provenance should describe the data generating process, i.e., survey or experimental procedures: - Experiments: complete sets of experimental instructions, questionnaires, stimuli for all conditions, potentially screenshots, scripts for experimenters or research assistants, as well as for subject eligibility criteria (e.g. selection criteria, exclusions), recruitment waves, demographics of subject pool used. - For lab experiments specifically, a description of any pilot sessions/studies, and computer programs, configuration files, or scripts used to run the experiment. - For surveys, the whole questionnaire (code or images/PDF) including survey logic if not linear, interviewer instructions, enumeration lists, sample selection criteria.</p>
<p>The information should describe ALL data used, regardless of whether they are provided as part of the replication archive or not, and regardless of size or scope. For instance, if using GDP deflators, the source of the deflators (e.g. at the national statistical office) should also be listed here. If any of this information has been provided in a pre-registration, then a link to that registration may (partially) suffice.</p>
<p>DAS can be complex and varied. Examples are provided <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_dcas.html">here</a>, and below.</p>
<p>Importantly, if providing the data as part of the replication package, authors should be clear about whether they have the <strong>rights</strong> to distribute the data. Data may be subject to distribution restrictions due to sensitivity, IRB, proprietary clauses in the data use agreement, etc.</p>
<p>NOTE: DAS do not replace Data Citations (see <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/Data_citation_guidance.html">Guidance</a>). Rather, they augment them. Depending on journal requirements and to some extent stylistic considerations, data citations should appear in the main article, in an appendix, or in the README. However, data citations only provide information <strong>where</strong> to find the data, not <strong>how to access</strong> that data. Thus, DAS augment data citations by going into additional detail that allow a researcher to assess cost, complexity, and availability over time of the data used by the original author.</p>

<h3 id="optional-but-recommended-license-for-data">(Optional, but recommended) License for Data</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Most data repositories provide for a default license, but do not impose a specific license. Authors should actively select a license. This should be provided in a LICENSE.txt file, separately from the README, possibly combined with the license for any code. Some data may be subject to inherited license requirements, i.e., the data provider may allow for redistribution only if the data is licensed under specific rules - authors should check with their data providers. For instance, a data use license might require that users - the current author, but also any subsequent users - cite the data provider. Licensing can be complex. Some non-legal guidance may be found <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Licensing_guidance.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="example-for-confidential-data">Example for confidential data</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Citing and describing confidential data, in particular when it does not have a regular distribution channel or online landing page, can be tricky. A citation can be crafted (<a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/FAQ.html#data-citation-without-online-link">see guidance</a>), and the DAS should describe how to access, whom to contact (including the role of the particular person, should that person retire), and other relevant information, such as required citizenship status or cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The data for this project (DESE, 2019) are confidential, but may be obtained with Data Use Agreements with the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). Researchers interested in access to the data may contact [NAME] at [EMAIL], also see www.doe.mass.edu/research/contact.html. It can take some months to negotiate data use agreements and gain access to the data. The author will assist with any reasonable replication attempts for two years following publication.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="example-for-confidential-census-bureau-data">Example for confidential Census Bureau data</h3>

<h2 id="computational-requirements">Computational requirements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: In general, the specific computer code used to generate the results in the article will be within the repository that also contains this README. However, other computational requirements - shared libraries or code packages, required software, specific computing hardware - may be important, and is always useful, for the goal of replication. Some example text follows.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: We strongly suggest providing setup scripts that install/set up the environment. Sample scripts for <a href="https://github.com/gslab-econ/template/blob/master/config/config_stata.do">Stata</a>, <a href="https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/paper-template/blob/master/programs/global-libraries.R">R</a>, <a href="https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/paper-template/blob/master/programs/packages.jl">Julia</a> are easy to set up and implement.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="software-requirements">Software Requirements</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: List all of the software requirements, up to and including any operating system requirements, for the entire set of code. It is suggested to distribute most dependencies together with the replication package if allowed, in particular if sourced from unversioned code repositories, Github repos, and personal webpages. In all cases, list the version <em>you</em> used.</p>

<h2 id="description-of-programscode">Description of programs/code</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Give a high-level overview of the program files and their purpose. Remove redundant/ obsolete files from the Replication archive.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Programs in <code>programs/01_dataprep</code> will extract and reformat all datasets referenced above. The file <code>programs/01_dataprep/master.do</code> will run them all.</li>
<li>Programs in <code>programs/02_analysis</code> generate all tables and figures in the main body of the article. The program <code>programs/02_analysis/master.do</code> will run them all. Each program called from <code>master.do</code> identifies the table or figure it creates (e.g., <code>05_table5.do</code>). Output files are called appropriate names (<code>table5.tex</code>, <code>figure12.png</code>) and should be easy to correlate with the manuscript.</li>
<li>Programs in <code>programs/03_appendix</code> will generate all tables and figures in the online appendix. The program <code>programs/03_appendix/master-appendix.do</code> will run them all.</li>
<li>Ado files have been stored in <code>programs/ado</code> and the <code>master.do</code> files set the ADO directories appropriately.</li>
<li>The program <code>programs/00_setup.do</code> will populate the <code>programs/ado</code> directory with updated ado packages, but for purposes of exact reproduction, this is not needed. The file <code>programs/00_setup.log</code> identifies the versions as they were last updated.</li>
<li>The program <code>programs/config.do</code> contains parameters used by all programs, including a random seed. Note that the random seed is set once for each of the two sequences (in <code>02_analysis</code> and <code>03_appendix</code>). If running in any order other than the one outlined below, your results may differ.</li>

<h2 id="instructions-to-replicators">Instructions to Replicators</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: The first two sections ensure that the data and software necessary to conduct the replication have been collected. This section then describes a human-readable instruction to conduct the replication. This may be simple, or may involve many complicated steps. It should be a simple list, no excess prose. Strict linear sequence. If more than 4-5 manual steps, please wrap a master program/Makefile around them, in logical sequences. Examples follow.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Edit <code>programs/config.do</code> to adjust the default path</li>
<li>Run <code>programs/00_setup.do</code> once on a new system to set up the working environment.</li>
<li>Download the data files referenced above. Each should be stored in the prepared subdirectories of <code>data/</code>, in the format that you download them in. Do not unzip. Scripts are provided in each directory to download the public-use files. Confidential data files requested as part of your FSRDC project will appear in the <code>/data</code> folder. No further action is needed on the replicator’s part.</li>
<li>Run <code>programs/01_master.do</code> to run all steps in sequence.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="details-1">Details</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>programs/00_setup.do</code>: will create all output directories, install needed ado packages.
<ul>
<li>If wishing to update the ado packages used by this archive, change the parameter <code>update_ado</code> to <code>yes</code>. However, this is not needed to successfully reproduce the manuscript tables.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>programs/01_dataprep</code>:
<ul>
<li>These programs were last run at various times in 2018.</li>
<li>Order does not matter, all programs can be run in parallel, if needed.</li>
<li>A <code>programs/01_dataprep/master.do</code> will run them all in sequence, which should take about 2 hours.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>programs/02_analysis/master.do</code>.
<ul>

<li>Figure 1: The figure can be reproduced using the data provided in the folder “2_data/data_map”, and ArcGIS Desktop (Version 10.7.1) by following these (manual) instructions:
<ul>
<li>Create a new map document in ArcGIS ArcMap, browse to the folder “2_data/data_map” in the “Catalog”, with files “provinceborders.shp”, “lakes.shp”, and “cities.shp”.</li>
<li>Drop the files listed above onto the new map, creating three separate layers. Order them with “lakes” in the top layer and “cities” in the bottom layer.</li>
<li>Right-click on the cities file, in properties choose the variable “health”… (more details)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="list-of-tables-and-programs">List of tables and programs</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Your programs should clearly identify the tables and figures as they appear in the manuscript, by number. Sometimes, this may be obvious, e.g. a program called “<code>table1.do</code>” generates a file called <code>table1.png</code>. Sometimes, mnemonics are used, and a mapping is necessary. In all circumstances, provide a list of tables and figures, identifying the program (and possibly the line number) where a figure is created.</p>
<p>NOTE: If the public repository is incomplete, because not all data can be provided, as described in the data section, then the list of tables should clearly indicate which tables, figures, and in-text numbers can be reproduced with the public material provided.</p>
